      <b>About</b>
    </h4>
    <p>
      I'm a freelance/independent web/app developer with a background as a physics research scientist. These days I'm messing around with
      Alexa skills and voice controlled apps but that's just a small slice of me. I've developed web apps and iOS apps, done data analysis,
      written peer reviewed articles, gotten a PhD in experimental physics, interfaced hardware and software, done cleanroom micro and nanofabrication, taught college level physics,
      written an automatic GUI generating package for scientific programming, interfaced quantum bits or qubits to sound,
      and done countless presentations (once got asked if I had gotten professional voice training which I have not).
    </p>
    <p>
      I've changed programming
      languages and frameworks more times than I can remember and after 10+ years of coding, it really doesn't take much time to get up and running
      in whatever new thing I'm working with but if you are curious here's a noncomplete list of things I've worked with :
      C++, Java, Python, Matlab, Labview, Postscript, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Vue, AngularJS, Firebase, AWS, Google Cloud, PHP, C#,
      Unity, Swift, Markdown, Gridsome, GraphQL.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of my wide technical background, I'm pretty much a tech generalist and it's pretty hard to squeeze all that goodness into one resume.
      Thus I have multiple resumes (written in Markdown and processed through Gridsome static site generation and some custom Vue components I wrote to be both mobile
      responsive and print to one page). Pick the one that interests you most!
